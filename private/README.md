# Private

Here, you will find your own folder, the content of  which will not be committed to GitHub. It will only remain on your own laptop.

You can use this space to test, experiment, practice etc. without fear of overwriting anything, or running into conflict with somebody else's files.

Treat your folder as a temporary folder. If you switch computers, and clone the repository again, your folder will be empty.
